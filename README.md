Overview
========
This directory stores my theme-in-progress. It is built from the Carnegie theme

The proposed theming solution for edX (see [this pull](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/1907)
for more details) provides a number of hooks for themes to adjust
both HTML and CSS to their liking.
